Description 
---
GameTime is a website made to just have fun with friends, and like-minded individuals in a more competitive
fashion. Basically, you can create communities/tournaments between eachother, it could be going 1-on-1 in 
a competitive game such as Starcraft, Street Fighter, or Tetris, or even just seeing who can get to a certain point in a game. It doesn't even have to be video games, you could even set it to Ping-Pong!. 
It's all about having fun!

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

* express.js
* mySql
* React, Redux

MVP
---
The Minimum Product I was going for, was to have atleast a tournament bracket made that users
could interact with. Be able to Log-in, make a community, create a tournament.

Stretch Goals
---
* creating a messageboard within the communities, where only users that have joined/been approved can
view
* have tournament information be saved within the database, where the winner of that said tournament could
have a badge
* Game DB/api to make calls to, vgdb was something I was looking at, but was focused on geting MVP out first.
